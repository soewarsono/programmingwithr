<p>This post is kept (literally) minimal to demonstrate how simple is this hack using R (of course could be simple in other languages too). This is also to establish a point that R has got use-cases beyond statistics and data-mining.</p>
<div id="objective" class="section level3">
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p><code>rstats</code> subreddit is one of the popular sources of R-related information / discussion on the internet. We’re trying to extract the top posts of <code>rstats</code> subreddit.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-format" class="section level3">
<h3>Data Format</h3>
<p>Lucky for us, Reddit offers a json file for every subreddit (also post) and we’ll use that here.</p>
<pre class="html"><code>subreddit url: &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/&quot;
subreddit json: &quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/.json&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="jsonlite-action" class="section level3">
<h3>jsonlite @ Action</h3>
<p>The package that will help us in this endeavor is <code>jsonlite</code> (by <strong>Jeroen Ooms</strong> and Team) for parsing <code>json</code> files and feeds. It’s got a sweet function that <code>fromJSON()</code> that parses a json file and stores the result in a <code>list</code> object. Ultimately, we can find the required information - <code>title</code>, <code>url</code> of the subreddit in there.</p>
